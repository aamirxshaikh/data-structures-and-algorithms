## Approach

The approach used to solve this problem is the "Binary Search" algorithm, which falls under the pattern of "Searching".

### Algorithm

1. Initialize `start` and `end` pointers to the beginning and end of the sorted array, respectively.
2. While `start` is less than or equal to `end`:
    - Calculate the `mid` index as `start + (end - start) / 2`.
    - If the `target` is equal to the element at the `mid` index, return `mid`.
    - If the `target` is less than the element at the `mid` index, update `end` to `mid - 1` (search in the left half).
    - If the `target` is greater than the element at the `mid` index, update `start` to `mid + 1` (search in the right half).
3. If the loop terminates without finding the `target`, return `start`.

### Explanation

The algorithm uses the binary search approach to search for the `target` value in the sorted array. If the `target` value is found, its index is returned. Otherwise, the algorithm returns the index where the `target` value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the array.

The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the `target` value is found or the search interval becomes empty. At each step, the algorithm compares the `target` value with the middle element of the current search interval. If the `target` is equal to the middle element, its index is returned. If the `target` is less than the middle element, the search continues in the left half of the interval. If the `target` is greater than the middle element, the search continues in the right half of the interval.

If the loop terminates without finding the `target`, the `start` index represents the position where the `target` value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the array.

### Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the length of the input array, because the algorithm uses binary search, which has a time complexity of O(log n).
- Space Complexity: O(1), since the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.

### Pattern

This problem follows the "Searching" pattern, specifically the "Binary Search" algorithm, which is an efficient search technique for sorted arrays or lists.
