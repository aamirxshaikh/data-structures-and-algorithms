## Approach

The approach used to solve this problem is called the "Two Sum" approach, which falls under the pattern of "Hash Table" or "Dictionary".

### Algorithm

1. Create an empty HashMap `complementMap` to store the complement of each number and its index.
2. Iterate through the `nums` array:
    - For each number `nums[i]`, calculate its complement `complement = target - nums[i]`.
    - Check if `complementMap` contains the `complement`.
        - If it does, return an array containing the indices of `nums[i]` and the number whose index is `complementMap.get(complement)`.
    - If `complementMap` does not contain the `complement`, add `nums[i]` and its index `i` to the `complementMap`.
3. If no pair is found, return an empty array.

### Explanation

The algorithm uses a HashMap `complementMap` to store the complement of each number in the `nums` array (i.e., `target - nums[i]`) as the key, and its index as the value.

By iterating through the `nums` array and checking if the complement of the current number exists in the `complementMap`, we can find the indices of the two numbers whose sum is equal to the `target`.

If the complement exists in the `complementMap`, it means that the sum of the current number `nums[i]` and the number at the index stored in `complementMap.get(complement)` is equal to the `target`. In this case, we return an array containing the indices of these two numbers.

If the complement does not exist in the `complementMap`, we add the current number `nums[i]` and its index `i` to the `complementMap`.

### Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array, because it iterates through the array once.
- Space Complexity: O(n), due to the use of a HashMap to store the complements and their indices.

### Pattern

This problem follows the "Hash Table" or "Dictionary" pattern, where we use a HashMap (or any other dictionary data structure) to store and retrieve key-value pairs efficiently.
